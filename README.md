You should first clone the repository and load the app with Android Studio
Seems like there's a bug when you click on sign up, the app just quit and don't load the "Sign up" activity, does it do the same thing with you? I have no idea why its doing that
Now we should implement firebase and send the names and status (customers or employee) to firebase and be able to get them back for printing
if we decide to not do the firebase thing we can just store the names and status in a list localy and just do setText(names[x] + status[x])


++++) Sign up button fixed
